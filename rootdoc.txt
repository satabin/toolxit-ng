= ToolXiT =

ToolXiT is a bunch of tools allowing people to work on TeX files.

It consists of several parts that are separated in several packages according
to their role in processing TeX documents.

== Package Structure ==

These packages are named after the vocabulary used in the ''TeX Book'' by Donald Knuth.
 - [[toolxit `toolxit`]] is the top-level package containing the utility classes and object that
   are common to other packages,
 - [[toolxit.eyes `toolxit.eyes`]] contains the TeX eyes, i.e. the lexer,
 - [[toolxit.mouth `toolxit.mouth`]] contains the TeX mouth, i.e. the parser that consumes the tokens produced by the eyes,
 - [[toolxit.stomach `toolxit.stomach`]] contains the TeX stomach, i.e. the part that consumes the commands returned by the mouth.
